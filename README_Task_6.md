## Analysis  
- Longer passwords = stronger security.  
- More character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) = more resistance to attacks.  
- Avoid dictionary words and personal info.  
- Passphrases can be both secure and memorable.

## Common Attack Types & Mitigation  
- "Brute Force": Use long, unpredictable passwords.  
- "Dictionary Attack": Avoid common words.  
- "Credential Stuffing": Never reuse passwords across sites.  

## Tips for Creating Strong Passwords  
1. Use 12+ characters (15+ is better).  
2. Combine all character types.  
3. Avoid names, birth dates, or common phrases.  
4. Use a password manager.  
5. Enable 2FA wherever possible.
